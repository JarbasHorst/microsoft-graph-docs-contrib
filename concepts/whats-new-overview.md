### Device and app management | Cloud PC

- Removed the **type** property from the [cloudPcAuditResource](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcauditresource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. Going forward, use the **resourceType** property.
- Use the **deviceRegionName** property on [cloudPC](/graph/api/resources/cloudpc?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to get the name of the geographical region where the Cloud PC is currently provisioned.
- Use the **initiatedByUserPrincipalName** property on [cloudPcBulkAction](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcbulkaction?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to get the user principal name (UPN) of the user who initiated a bulk action.
- Use the **status** property on [cloudPcBulkAction](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcbulkaction?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to get the status of bulk actions.
- Perform bulk disaster recovery [failover](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcbulkdisasterrecoveryfailover?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [failback](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcbulkdisasterrecoveryfailback?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) actions to initiate the activation or deactivation of cross-region disaster recovery during regional outage scenarios.
- Deprecated the [getCloudPcRemoteActionResults](/graph/api/manageddevice-getcloudpcremoteactionresults?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method in favor of the [retrieveCloudPcRemoteActionResults](/graph/api/cloudpc-retrievecloudpcremoteactionresults?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method.
- Use the [retrieveCrossRegionDisasterRecoveryReport](/graph/api/cloudpcreports-retrievecrossregiondisasterrecoveryreport?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method on the [cloudPcReports](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcreports?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource to retrieve the Windows 365 cross-region disaster recovery report with configuration health check results, disaster recovery status, latest cross-region restore points, and user settings.

### Files

You can now [discard a checkout](/graph/api/driveitem-discardcheckout?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of a [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

- You can now control multifactor authentication (MFA) on an individual user basis, commonly referred to as per-user MFA on the Microsoft Entra admin center, by using the [authenticationMethod](/graph/api/resources/authenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource and its associated methods.
- While [restoring soft-deleted users](/graph/api/directory-deleteditems-restore?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), you can now specify whether Microsoft Entra ID should autoreconcile conflicting proxy addresses if one or more of the soft-deleted user's proxy addresses are currently used for an active user.

### Identity and access | Network access

You can now enable and control compliant network check with Conditional Access through the Global Secure Access service by using the [compliantNetworkNamedLocation resource type](/graph/api/resources/compliantnetworknamedlocation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and its associated methods.

### Security | Threat intelligence

Use the [relatedHosts](/graph/api/security-sslcertificate-list-relatedhosts?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method to get a list of related [host](/graph/api/resources/security-host?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources associated with an [sslCertificate](/graph/api/resources/security-sslcertificate?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Sites and lists

Added [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) support to sites. You can apply content models to SharePoint document libraries to classify and extract metadata from files. The new APIs enable you to do the following:

- Use [Get model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [Get model by name](/graph/api/contentmodel-getbyname?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) methods to get a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource. 
- Add a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to a library by using the [add to drive](/graph/api/contentmodel-addtodrive?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method to make it ready to process files.
- Remove a [content model](/graph/api/resources/contentmodel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) from a library by using the [remove from drive](/graph/api/contentmodel-removefromdrive?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) method.
- Use [Get applied drives](/graph/api/contentmodel-getapplieddrives?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to list all libraries associated with the content model.

The content model automatically processes new files that are added to the libraries. You can create [document processing jobs](/graph/api/resources/documentprocessingjob?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to process existing files.

### Tasks and plans

[Assign a sensitivity label](/graph/api/plannerroster-assignsensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to a [plannerRoster](/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

### Teamwork and communications | Calls and online meetings

- Introduced the ability to [list](/graph/api/virtualeventregistration-list?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [create](/graph/api/virtualeventregistration-post?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [cancel](/graph/api/virtualeventregistration-cancel?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [list sessions](/graph/api/virtualeventregistration-list-sessions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for virtual event meeting registrations.
- [Delete](/graph/api/virtualeventregistrationquestionbase-delete?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a registration question from a [webinar](/graph/api/resources/virtualeventwebinar?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). The question can either be a [predefined registration question](/graph/api/resources/virtualeventregistrationpredefinedquestion?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or a [custom registration question](/graph/api/resources/virtualeventregistrationcustomquestion?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
